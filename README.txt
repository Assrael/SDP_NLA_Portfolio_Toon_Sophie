Intro:
Spellslingers is the outcome of the Senior Design Project: Next Level Arcade course at the University of Texas at Austin during the fall semester 2020. I was in a group of eight, and I was one of three programmers. 

Project Description:

Spellslingers is a one-on-one controls light versus game. The primary game play is both player's choose their characters and wave their wands (the controllers) through multiple rounds until one of the player loses all their health. The game takes a lot of insperation of minigames you'd find on Wii titles such as Mario Party. Each character has their own weaknesses and strengths making your choice in character matter.

2. Overview of my role and what I did

As the other two focused on the battle system, I created everything else for the game. Mainly the Menu's and character animators (I set up the animators in engine from sprite sheets, not to be confused with me drawing them). 

The following scripts can be found in a Zip named Sophie Scripts.
List of scripts made:
- BackgroundSelection
- BattleSetup
- CharacterAttributes
- CharacterSelection
- CharacterStats
- GameManager
- StartGame
- Tutorial*

* was worked on partial by another programmer

I implemented 18 sprite sheets, Made 18 unique animations, and 9 animators. Additonally I set up the layout of the main menu, character select (all screens), and the post battle menu for both the tutorial and battle scene.

4. Process overview.
When we started the process of creating our game it was just Nevin and I as the programmers. We knew that the battle system would take a lot of work, so we decided to split all the work between that and the rest. I ended up doing the rest of course and I think it's a good thing we did. While most of my scripts weren't as complex as the battle script, they were essential of getting everything else to work. At first it was just a simple menu and character select (with no colors or stage select) but over time we added more elements for players to choose, such as options and a tutorial. The second big part was getting the animations to work for each character. There was a lot of back and forth between me and the artists when it came to the sprite sheet layout and size. I want to say we went through at least five iterations of the animations before we got something we liked. The last few weeks were just adding quality of life features like an idle reset that would acitvate if players left the game running, and of course various bug fixes. I also did the work of setting up the build on the PC that the game runs on.
